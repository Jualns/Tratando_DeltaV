# Process DeltaV

This code processes the DeltaV file, which contains a large dataset with hundreds of rows and dozens of columns related to the reactors in the GPC industry.

This app uses **Polars** to handle this data efficiently and **Plotly** to visualize the results. To assist scientists in the R&D laboratory, the app also saves the processed file in Excel format.
